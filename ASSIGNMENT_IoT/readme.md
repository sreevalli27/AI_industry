**Brief on Sensor**
We have used DHT11 sensor. It is a low-cost digital sensor capable of measuring temperature and humidity. It is commonly used in various applications, including home automation, weather stations, and environmental monitoring. The sensor provides accurate and reliable data.

**Implementation**
● Connect the DHT11 sensor to a Raspberry Pi using a GPIO pin.
● Use the Adafruit DHT library to read data from the sensor.
● Log the temperature and humidity data to a CSV file at regular intervals.
● Analyze the collected data to make informed decisions about greenhouse conditions, such as controlling fans or adjusting watering schedules.
